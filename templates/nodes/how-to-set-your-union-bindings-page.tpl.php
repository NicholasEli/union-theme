      <p>Congratulations on your new set of Union Bindings. Union Bindings are the higest-performing, best-fitting bindings money can buy.</p>
      <p>Bindings are the most important piece of snowboarding equipment you own. That being said, it’s crucial that they are set up properly to ensure optimal fit and performance. This guide will give you all the info you need to dial in the proper boot-in-binding fit.</p>
      <p>If this is your first time setting up a snowboard, we highly suggest going into an Authorized Union Dealer for assistance. Your stance is something that you can set up in 5 minutes but it may take you 5 years to perfect.</p>
      <p>Remember, there is no right or wrong, so experiment with it and find what works for you.</p>
      <p>Warning: Snowboarding is a hazardous sport which can result in serious injury or, in certain circumstances, death. Snowboard bindings by design do not release upon impact. Make sure all of your hardware is tight before each use, you ride within your ability level, and you abide by the mountain responsibility code. By using this equipment, all risk is assumed by you.</p>

          <p>Stance Width: Either get tech with a tape measure, or just eyeball it to find out what looks and feels best. You may need to experiment to find the stance that works best for your style of riding. If you have no idea how wide/narrow of a stance to ride, try going slightly wider than shoulder width and modify from there.</p>

          <p>Tip: When setting up your board make sure the ratchets are facing the tip and tail. Don’t put your bindings on backwards!</p>

          <p>Universal Disk (4X4 + Channel Compatibility):</p>
          <p>Align your disk with the boards inserts that you plan on using. If you’re using the Channel you will only need to use two washers and two screws to mount each binding. If you are using a traditional 4X4 mounting system be sure to use all four washers and screws. Begin by threading one screw with a washer. Make sure that the disk doesn’t move or you will have a hard time threading the remaining inserts. Next, thread the remaining screws and washers into place. Hardware should be hand tightened using a #3 Phillips Screwdriver.</p>

          <p>Mini Disk (4X2 Pattern + Channel Compatibility):</p>
          <p>In order to mount the Ultra, Contact Pro or Legacy we have found that it’s best to use the following technique. First, align your disk with the board’s inserts that you plan on using. If you’re using the Channel you will only need to use two washers and two screws to mount each binding. If you are using a traditional 4X4 mounting system be sure to use all four washers and screws. Begin by threading one screw with NO washer. This will pull the binding closer to the top sheet and allow you to easily thread the remaining screws and washers. Once you have threaded the remaining screws take out the first screw and rethread the first screw WITH a washer. Hardware should be hand tightened using a #3 Phillips Screwdriver.</p>
